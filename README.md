## Project Description: 
The purpose of this project is to allow the user to be able to pick between how many characters they want, wether they want uppercase, lower case, special and numerical characters. After the information has been gathered from the user, the generator will generate a random password that the user can then be able to use and copy. The JS in this generator is made mainly from the generatePassword function although there are 2 functions.
